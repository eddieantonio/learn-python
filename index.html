# Lesson 0: Start your text editors

---
layout: false

- Download and install [Python 2.7][python]
- Get a text editor
  * [TextWrangler][] (Mac OS X)
  * [Notepad++][] (Windows)
  * Gedit? Nano? I dunno lol. (Linux)
- Create a folder where we're going to write some programs.

[python]: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/
[TextWrangler]: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/
[Notepad++]: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.8.html

???

We're going to make sure everything is installed and works and is happy in
this step. We need a text editor. The Mac options are straightforward and so
are Windows. For Linux... yeesh. But we'll get to that as it occurs.

# Absolute basic command line stuff!

--

- `cd` **change directory**
--

- `ls` **list directory**
--

- `python` **start Python**
--


The `$` is a shorthand for your **prompt**. This means that the *shell*
(command line) is ready to interpret a command. **Do not type this out!**

```sh
$ cd Documents/Python
```

```sh
$ ls
```

```sh
$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2 + 2
4
```

--

Change into the directory where we're going to be doing work stuff!

# Lesson 1: Greetings

---

This is your first program:

```python
print "Hello, World!"
```

Write it and save it as `hello.py`. Then run it.

???

We're going to write the most basic program, just to get our feet wet.

---

- What happened?
--

- Use single quotes
--

- Make it say `Hello, "World"!`

???

Then we're going to make tiny changes to it, as an exercise:

 * Use single quotes instead of double quotes
 * Add quotes around "world"
 * Add backslashes

# Lesson 3: Math
## AKA, dilly daddling in the Python interpreter

---

Do some math!

```python
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> 2 - 3

>>> (345 + 3) * 9
3132
```

# Operators

Remember the TI-83? It's a lot like that.


- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` do what you expect
- `**` does exponents. (`^` does something completely different).
- `%` (called *modulo*) gives you the remainder of dividing two numbers.

---

- Does Python follow order of operations?
- What happens when you type `1/3`?
--

- How about `1.0/3.0`?



---
template: inverse

# Lesson 4: Types

---

Python can do different things with different values. But before it knows how
to do something (say, add two values), it needs to know what kind of values
they are, and what are valid operations between them. These are what types
are. A category for each kind of value.  There are two different kinds of
numbers:

- `int` — integers with as many digits as your memory can handle
  ```python
>>> 10 ** 100
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000L
```

- `float` — approximation of real numbers with fixed number of digits
  after the (binary!) point.
  ```python
>>> 10.0 ** 100
1e+100
```

--

**THEY ARE NOT THE SAME**.

---

- This is an `int`:

```python
42
```

- This is a `float`.

```python
42.0
```


--

- to convert an int to a float, type `float(the_int_you_want_to_convert)`.
--


```python
>>> float(42)
42.0
```

???

This may seem redundant here, but it becomes necessary later.

--

- Alternatively, just write at least one float in the numbers you want to
operate on.


```python
>>> 1/3.0
0.3333333333333333
```

--
- You may get unexpected results due to the nature of floats vs. ints:

```python
>>> (  30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
...  - 30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0)
0.0
>>> (  30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
...  - 30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
1L
```

---

**But types don't stop at just numbers.**



---

# Lesson 5: Strings

---

- We've already seen an example of strings.
--

- Python calls 'em `str` (because who likes vowels anyway?).
--

- We can do more with strings than just print them on the screen.

---

There are two different ways of writing strings: with single quotes and with
double quotes.

--

```python
>>> "Buenos" + " dias"
'Buenos dias'
>>> 'or I can use single quotes'
'or I can use single quotes'
>>> 'but I cannot use both"
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

```

--

Both notations mean the **same thing**.


---

# But what if we combine numbers and strings?

```python
>>> "I'll see you at " + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and
'int' objects
```

--

- `“I’ll see you at “` is a String
- `2` is an Integer

--
- Python gets upset when we mix types (like in 1950s America).


---

- Protip: use `type(value)` if you're unsure of what the type of a value is.

--

```python
>>> type("Ladies Learning Code")
<type 'str'>
>>> type(6)
<type 'int'>
>>>
type(6.1)
<type 'float'>
>>> type(6.0)
<type 'float'>
```


---

# We can change types.

- `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` all try to convert whatever you give them to
  their respective type.

--

```python
>>> "I'll see you at " + str(2)
"I'll see you at 2"
>>> 1 + int("2")
3
```

---

# It's not magic though

```python
>>> 1 + int("two")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'two'
```

# Lesson 6: Using Functions

---

- Sometimes we want to do more than basic arithmetic.
--

- Functions are like sleeping code dragons, waiting to be awakened.
--

- You've already used some functions: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`,
  `type()`.sup[\*].
--
 `print` is not a function (in Python 2, at least)...
--

- **Always use parentheses `()` to awaken the code dragons.**
--

- The things you give functions are called *arguments*.
--
 Some functions take a small, fixed amount of them; some take an unlimited
amount; some take none at all.
--

- Most of the functions we will look at will take one or two arguments, or no
  arguments at all.

???

\* Technically, those are callables and above that -- class constructors.


---

# Built in functions


- There are several useful [built-in
  functions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html).

--

- `abs(num)` gives the absolute value of `num`
```python
>>> abs(-6)
6
```
--

- `help(value)` gives you interactive help for any 'ol thing you wish to ask
  for.
--
 To ask for help for a function, **omit the parentheses!**

```python
>>> help(abs())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: abs() takes exactly one argument (0 given)
```
--

- A lot of the other built-ins are a bit too esoteric for an intro to programming
  though... :/


---

# Modules

- Modules are ready made collections of code.
- I use the term module synonymously with "[code] library".
- Python is known for being a "batteries included" language
  with a veritable [crap tonne of modules][mods]. There's even [a website
  devoted][pymotw] to a tour of the "standard library".

[mods]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/
[pymotw]: http://pymotw.com/2/contents.html
--

- Use a module with the `import` statement:

```python
>>> import math
```
--

- To use functions that belong to the module, **use the dot (`.`)**.
- The `.` is like 's in English. So `math.sqrt` means "`math`'s `sqrt`
  function".
--

```python
>>> math.sqrt(2)
1.4142135623730951
```

---

# Some useful modules

- `math` — contains `sqrt()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `atan2()`, `log()`,
  plus constants like `pi` and `e`:

```python
>>> import math
>>> 2 * math.pi
6.283185307179586
>>> math.atan2(10, 1)
1.4711276743037347
```
--

- `random` — generates *psuedorandom* numbers. `random()`, `randint()`,
  `shuffle()`, and `choice()` are pretty dang useful.

```python
>>> import random
>>> random.random()
0.14501424363328552
>>> random.randint(1, 10)
5
```
--

- `os` and `sys` are some other of the most imported modules in Python.

---

# Methods

- Sometimes, functions belong to values.
- These functions are called **methods**.
--
 They typically act on the value they belong to.
--

- Strings have [a bunch of useful methods][str-methods]: `.upper()`,
  `.lower()`, `.title()`, `.capitalize()`, `.replace()`.

```python
>>> "edmonton".capitalize()
'Edmonton'
>>> "George Washington".replace("Washington", "Clinton")
'George Clinton'
>>> "moar python".upper()
'MOAR PYTHON!!!'
```

[str-methods]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
--

- Try out some string methods! Use `help(str)` to find even more of them!

---

# String Format

- One really useful string method is `.format()`.
--

- The string given is like a template; `{}` signifies a placeholder where a
  value is supposed to go.
--

- Makes inserting a bunch of numbers into a string a whole lot less awkward.

```python
>>> "The answer of " + str(2) + " + " + str(2) + " is " + str(2 + 2)
'The answer of 2 + 2 is 4'
>>> "The answer of {} + {} is {}".format(2, 2, 2 + 2)
'The answer of 2 + 2 is 4'
```

# Lesson 7: Variables

---

# Variables

- Programmers like to keep things **DRY**.
--
 Don't
--
 Repeat
--
 Yourself.
--

- To do this, we use *names* or *variables*.

???

I use the terms *variables* and *names* more or less synonymously. In Python,
they're called names because that's just what they are -- names for values.
Though the term in computer science in general is just "variable".

---

# Names

- We give names to values by using `=`:

```python
>>> password = "SuperSecure"
>>> password
'SuperSecure'
>>> num1 = 4
>>> num1
4
>>> num2 = 1234.5
>>> num2
1234.5
```
--

- `=` always means: calculate whatever is on the **right hand side** down to a
  single value; give that value the name on the **left hand side**.
--

- Typing a name simply recalls the value associated with it.

???

This is where Python stops resembling math. `=` does not mean what it means in
math. At all.
--
- Names can't begin with a number or have a space in them.  Use an underscore
  when you want to use a space.


---

# Assignment, Rebinding, &c.

- If you slap the same name onto a new value, the old value will be **entirely
  forgotten**.
- This is cool though, because that's actually really useful. We'll see why
  later.

---

# Let’s throw a party

```python
>>> party_budget = 1000
>>> venture_capitalist_investment = 100000
>>> party_budget + venture_capitalist_investment
101000
```

What is your party budget now?

---

# New Budget

```pythog
>>> party_budget
1000
```

Aw geez. It's still the same!
--
 We have to tell the `party_budget` it has a new value:


```python
>>> party_budget = party_budget + venture_capitalist_investment
>>> party_budget
101000
```

---

# The guestlist

```python
>>> guestlist = "Peter June Shreek"
>>> guestlist_copy = guestlist
>>> guestlist_copy
'Peter June Shreek'
>>> guestlist = guestlist + " Roberto"
>>> guestlist
'Peter June Shreek Roberto'
>>> guestlist_copy
'Peter June Shreek'
```

---

# Anything you can do with any ol' value, you can do to a name

```python
>>> startup = "my elephant brain"
>>> startup.title()
'My Elephant Brain'
>>> revenue = -429376
>>> abs(revenue)
429376
>>> revenue + 1000000
570624
```

---

# But did the variable change?

```python
>>> startup
'my elephant brain'
```

The string methods **return a new value**, leaving the original intact.

---

# String formatting, revisited

Now string formats make sense:

```python
>>> utensil = "spoon"
>>> "My {} is too big".format(utensil)
'My spoon is too big'
>>> "The {0} came before the {1}".format('chicken', 'egg')
'The chicken came before the egg'
>>> "The {1} came before the {0}".format('chicken', 'egg')
'The egg came before the chicken'
>>> template = "The Jaguar F-Type has {}hp"
>>> template.format(488)
'The Jaguar F-Type has 488hp'
```

???

Now would be an apt time to exercise using functions and methods on variables.


---

# Recap

- Names save us from repeating ourselves.
- Anything you can do to a value you can do to a name — a name just fetches
  the value, after all.
- Variables don't change until you tell them to.
- Use `str.format()`.

# Lesson 8: Programs

---

# Honest-to-goodness programs

- We're actually going to use our text editors now.
- Create a new file called `party.py`.
- Add the following code:

```python
party_budget = 1500
party_budget
```

---

# Run it

```sh
 $ cd the-folder-with-stuff-in-it
 $ python party.py
```

--

- What happened? Where's my party budget?

---

# In scripts, you have to tell Python to print stuff.

--
```python
party_budget = 1500
print party_budget
```

---

# Comments

- Anything after a `#` in a line is ignored.

```python
# This is a comment
print 'Hello World' # so is this
#print("this won't be printed")
```

--
- Allows you to write sweet love letters to your maintenance programmer

--
- And explain what was going on in your head when you were writing the dang
  code.
--
 Which is greatly appreciated by anybody reading your code; more so than my
 love letters, in my experience.

---

# Asking for input

- Another built-in function: `raw_input()` prompts the user to type a line.
--

- **It always returns a `str`!**

```python
# raw input prompts the user
raw_input("Please enter your name:\n")
# store the result in a variable
my_name = raw_input("Please enter your name:\n")
# store the result in a variable
my_age = int(raw_input("How old are you?\n"))
```

---

# A ticket app

- We’re going to write a ticket app for Peter’s Python Prognostications
- Here’s how it’s work
  1. We start with 8 tickets
  2. We ask the user how many they want
  3. We print out that number
  4. We show the user how many tickets are left



---
template: inverse

# Lesson 9: Conditionals

---

# Control flow

- Most programs don’t run line by line from start to end
- They jump around according to rules
- One way to specify those rules is to use conditions

---

# Boolean logic

- All about yes or no questions
- We frequently want to test if two values are equal
- For equality we use the **double equal** sign
  - `1 == 1`
- We can test if two things aren’t equal with `!=`
  - `1 != 2`
- There are also many of the math operators we know
  - Greater than: `>`
  - Greater than or equal to: `>=`
  - Less than: `<`
  - Less than or equal to: `<=`

---

# Exercise

- In the Python shell use all the operators in the previous slide.

---

# Boolean type

- A new type! Hoorah!
- Only two values. Ever. `True` or `False`.
- Useful for making a decision.

---

# `if` statement

```python
if 1 == 1:
    print "I am a prickly pear."
```

---

# Indentation

- Stuff you only want to be done in the `if` is indented.

```python
# so beautiful
if True:
    print "wir sind die Roboter"
# NOPE!
if True:
print "ya tvoy robotnik"
```

---

# `else` statement

```python
if 0:
    print "0 is always false"
else:
    print "So the else clause is executed"
```

---

# `elif` statement

```python
today = "Saturday"

if today == "Friday":
    print "Everybody’s working for the weekend!"
elif today ==  "Saturday":
    print "S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y Night!"
elif today == "Sunday":
    print  "Pancakes."
else:
    print "Early to bed and early to rise."
```

---

# Exercises

- Stop the user from buying tickets if they ask for more than are available
- Write a program that asks you what your favourite colour is and tells you
  something else that is the same colour.

        What is your favourite colour? Green
        I like turtles

  - `raw_input()` and `.lower()` might be useful to you.

# Lesson 10: While loops

---

# Getting loopy

- So far our code has run from top to bottom
- Programs usually need to do something over and over again
- Computers are literally made to do menial, repetitive tasks

---

# `while` loop

```python
# "while" something is true
# perform an action
while True:
    print 'Are we there yet?'
# use Ctrl + c to cancel the program
```

---

# We need a way to stop the loop

```python
# code within the loop should invalidate the condition
loop = True
while loop:
    print 'Are we there yet?'
    loop = False
print 'Done the loop'
```

---

# Or we could ask the user for input

```python
loop = True
while loop:
    answer = raw_input('Are we there yet? ')
    loop = answer == 'no'
print 'Done the loop'
```

---

# break dancing

```python
# or we can use the break keyword
loop = True
while loop:
    print 'Are we there yet?‘
    break
print 'Done the loop'
```

???

`break` unconditionally stops the loop. It's typically used inside an `if`
statement.

---

# To run a certain number of times we test a variable and increment within the loop

```python
x=1
while x < 10:
    print x
    x += 1
```

---

# Exercise: Print from 10 to 1

--
```python
x = 10
while x > 0:
    print x
    x -= 1
```

---

# Exercise

- We’re going to write a game for the computer
- The computer will pick a number and we have to guess it

```python
import random
x = random.randint(1, 10)
```

- The user should know if they are too high or too low
- We know how to ask for input
- We know how to compare guesses
- We want to give the user multiple chances (maybe 3?)

# Lesson 11: Lists

---

# Lists

- Lists are lists
- That was useless
- But seriously, they’re just an **ordered collection of values**.
- Lists can hold strings, integers, floats, booleans, and anything else you
can create

---

# Creating lists

```python
>>> mylist = [1,2,3,4]
>>> mylist
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> companies = ['My Elephant Brain', 're:3D', 'Hacker You']
>>> companies
['My Elephant Brain', 're:3D', 'Hacker You']
>>> kitchen_sink = [1 , 'a', True]
>>> kitchen_sink
[1, 'a', True]
```
---

# Accessing items in a list

```python
>>> companies[1]
're:3D'
>>> companies[-1]
'Hacker You'
>>> companies[10]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

---

# Useful list functions

- `len(list)` returns the length of the given list.
- `range(stop)` or `range(start, stop, step)` returns a list that counts from
  `start` up to *but not including* `end`, by `step`. By default `start` is
  `0` and `step` is `1`.
- `str.split()` gives you a list of words from a string, where words are
  separated by spaces.

```python
>>> range(5)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> len(range(5))
5
>>> "Hello, my name is Inigio Montoya.".split()
['Hello,', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'Inigio', 'Montoya.']
```

---

# Exercise

- Using a list and a while loop, print the days of the week
- `break` the loop on Wednesday

---

# Modifying a List

```python
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> # Add an item
>>> l.append(5)
>>> l
[1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> # Remove an item
>>> l.remove(3)
>>> l
[1, 2, 5]
>>> # remove throws an error if the item doesn't exist
>>> l.remove(9)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
```

# Lesson 12: For loops

---

```python
# for loops make it easy to loop over a list
for company in companies:
    print company

# they're also useful for looping
# a known number of times
for i in range(1, 10):
  print i
```

---

# Exercise

- Use a for loop to print the days of the week
- Use a for loop to count from 10 to 1
   - Hint: by default range() increases by 1 each time, but you can give it a
     third argument to tell it the number to increment by each time
   - e.g., `range(0, 10, 2)`

# Programming challenge!


- Let's make a hangman game using what we learned.
- Hangman credit to Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner
- But before you start coding away, it helps to think about what you're trying
  to do.
- Remember, computers need specific instructions, so you need to break it
  down.
- You can start by playing hangman on paper with each other.
- Start with [`hangman_draft.py`](./hangman_draft.py). Replace `<CODE HERE>`
  with the appropriate code!
