# Lesson 0: Start your text editors

---

- Download and install [Python 2.7][python]
- Get a text editor
  * [TextWrangler][] (Mac OS X)
  * [Notepad++][] (Windows)
  * Gedit? Nano? I dunno lol. (Linux)
- Create a folder where we're going to write some programs.

[python]: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/
[TextWrangler]: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/
[Notepad++]: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.8.html

???

We're going to make sure everything is installed and works and is happy in
this step. We need a text editor. The Mac options are straightforward and so
are Windows. For Linux... yeesh. But we'll get to that as it occurs.

# Absolute basic command line stuff!

--

- `cd` **change directory**
--

- `ls` **list directory**
--

- `python` **start Python**
--


(The `$` is a shorthand for your **prompt**. This means that the *shell*
(command line) is ready to interpret a command. **Do not type this out!*)

```sh
$ cd Documents/Python
```

```sh
$ ls
```

```sh
$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2 + 2
4
```

--

Change into the directory where we're going to be doing work stuff!

# Lesson 1: Greetings

---

This is your first program:

```python
print "Hello, World!"
```

Write it and save it as `hello.py`. Then run it.

???

We're going to write the most basic program, just to get our feet wet.

---

- What happened?
--

- Use single quotes
--

- Make it say `Hello, "World"!`

???

Then we're going to make tiny changes to it, as an exercise:

 * Use single quotes instead of double quotes
 * Add quotes around "world"
 * Add backslashes

- Python interpreter/interactive console
--

- Command line
--

- Program/script

# Lesson 3: Math
## AKA, Dillydaddling in the Python interpreter

---

Do some math!

```python
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> 2 - 3
-1
>>> (345 + 3) * 9
3132
```

---

- Does Python follow order of operations?
- What happens when you type `1/3`?
--

- How about `1.0/3.0`?
